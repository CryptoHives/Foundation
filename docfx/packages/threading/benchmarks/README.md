# Benchmark Results

This directory contains benchmark results generated by BenchmarkDotNet.

## Updating Benchmark Results

To update benchmark results after a local run:

1. Run the benchmarks using the test project:
   ```cmd
   cd tests\Threading
   dotnet run -c Release -- --filter "*Benchmark*"
   ```

2. Execute the update script from the repository root:
   ```cmd
   scripts\update-benchmark-docs.cmd
   ```

The script copies the latest benchmark markdown files from
`tests/Threading/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/` to this directory
with simplified filenames.

## Important Notes

- Benchmarks should be run on a local machine with minimal background load
- Results are machine-specific and may vary between systems
- The benchmark files are included in the documentation via docfx `[!INCLUDE]` directives
