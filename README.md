# 🛡️ CryptoHives Open Source Initiative 🐝

The **CryptoHives Open Source Initiative** brings consistent, portable, and auditable cryptography to .NET — managed code first, OS quirks gone.

# 🐝 CryptoHives Open Source Initiative .NET Packages

The **CryptoHives Open Source Initiative** is a collection of modern, high-assurance cryptographic libraries for .NET, developed and maintained by **The Keepers of the CryptoHives**. 
Each package is designed for security, interoperability, and clarity — making it easy to build secure systems without sacrificing developer experience.
There are also supporting packages which improve memory usage and thread synchronization for high performance transformation pipelines and for cryptography workloads.

## ✨ Overview

The **CryptoHives.Foundation** project serves as the first core building block for .NET libraries under the **CryptoHives Open Source Initiative** umbrella.

All implementations are developed **from first principles**, without reliance on operating system or native platform crypto providers, ensuring:

- 🔒 **Security Transparency** — all algorithms are clean-room verified and auditable  
- ⚙️ **Predictable Performance** — optimized memory usage and allocation-free APIs 
- 🧱 **Composable Architecture** — designed for integration in modern .NET applications, from libraries to microservices

## 🧬 Features

### 🔐 Clean-Room Cryptography
- Fully managed implementations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms
- No dependency on OS or hardware cryptographic APIs
- Deterministic behavior across all platforms and runtimes
- Support for both classical and modern primitives (AES, ChaCha20, SHA-2/3, etc.)

### ⚡ High-Performance Primitives
CryptoHives provides a growing set of utilities designed to optimize high performance transformation pipelines and cryptography workloads:

### 🛠️ Memory Efficiency
- **ArrayPool-based allocators** for common crypto and serialization scenarios
- Pooled implementations of `MemoryStream` and `IBufferWriter<T>` for transformation pipelines
- Primitives to handle ownership of pooled buffers using `ReadOnlySequence<T>` with `ArrayPool<T>`
- Zero-copy, zero-allocation design for high-frequency read/write operations

### 🛠️ Concurrency Tools
- Lightweight Async-compatible synchronization primitives based on `ObjectPool` and `ValueTask<T>`
- High-performance threading helpers designed to reduce allocations of `Task` and `TaskCompletionSource<T>`

    public void WriteChunk(ReadOnlySpan<byte> chunk)
    {
        using var writer = new ArrayPoolMemoryStream(defaultBufferSize);
        writer.Write(chunk);
        ReadOnlySequence<byte> sequence = writer.GetReadOnlySequence();
        var result = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(sequence);
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Clean-Room Policy

All code within the **CryptoHives Open Source Initiative** is written and validated under **strict clean-room conditions**:

- No reverse engineering or derived code from existing proprietary libraries  
- Implementations are verified against public specifications and test vectors  
- Review process includes formal algorithm validation and peer verification  

---

## 🔐 Security Policy

Security is our top priority.

If you discover a vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, please follow the guidelines on the [CryptoHives Open Source Initiative Security Page](https://github.com/CryptoHives/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
