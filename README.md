## 🧬 Features and Design Principles

### 🧱 Orthogonal Design
- All development is done on free and open-source tools, e.g. .NET SDK, Visual Studio Community Edition, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.
- Each package is designed to be orthogonal and composable with other CryptoHives packages to avoid deep cross dependencies
- Dependencies on other packages are kept to a minimum and shall only include widely adopted, well-maintained libraries, e.g. the Microsoft.Extensions
- OS and hardware dependencies are avoided wherever possible to ensure deterministic behavior across all platforms and runtimes, specifically for security implementations
- There is no intention to replace or shadow existing .NET class libraries; instead, CryptoHives packages are designed to complement and extend existing functionality

### ⚡ High-Performance Primitives
- CryptoHives provides a growing set of utilities designed to optimize high performance transformation pipelines and cryptography workloads.

### 🛠️ Memory Efficiency
Pooled buffer management for transformation pipelines and high-frequency I/O:
- **ArrayPool-based allocators** for common crypto and serialization scenarios
- `ArrayPoolMemoryStream` — drop-in `MemoryStream` replacement backed by `ArrayPool<byte>`
- `ReadOnlySequenceMemoryStream` — read from `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` without copying
- `ArrayPoolBufferWriter<T>` — `IBufferWriter<T>` over pooled arrays
- Ownership primitives for zero-copy handoff of pooled buffers

### 🚀 Concurrency Tools (Threading)
Async-compatible synchronization primitives built on `ObjectPool` and `ValueTask<T>`.
Designed to eliminate `Task` / `TaskCompletionSource<T>` allocations on the hot path.

- `AsyncLock` — mutual exclusion
- `AsyncSemaphore` — counting semaphore
- `AsyncAutoResetEvent` / `AsyncManualResetEvent`
- `AsyncReaderWriterLock`
- `AsyncBarrier` / `AsyncCountdownEvent`

All primitives support `CancellationToken` and `ConfigureAwait(false)` without the need for extra allocations.
Nuget package contains a C# analyzer to avoid common ValueTask usage mistakes.

### 🔐 Managed Code Cryptography
Fully managed implementations of cryptographic hash algorithms and MACs, written from NIST/RFC/ISO specifications and verified against official test vectors.
No OS crypto dependency — deterministic results on every platform, in some cases even outperforming OS implementations.

**Algorithms:**

| Family | Algorithms |
|--------|-----------|
| SHA-2 | SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256 |
| SHA-3 | SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512 |
| Keccak | Keccak-256, Keccak-384, Keccak-512 (Ethereum compatible) |
| SHAKE / cSHAKE | SHAKE128, SHAKE256, cSHAKE128, cSHAKE256 |
| TurboSHAKE / KT | TurboSHAKE128, TurboSHAKE256, KT128, KT256 |
| BLAKE | BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s (SIMD-accelerated), BLAKE3 |
| Ascon | Ascon-Hash256, Ascon-XOF128 (NIST lightweight) |
| MAC | KMAC128, KMAC256, BLAKE2 keyed, BLAKE3 keyed |
| Regional | SM3, Streebog-256/512, Whirlpool, RIPEMD-160 |
| Legacy | SHA-1, MD5 (backward compatibility only) |

All XOF algorithms implement `IExtendableOutput` for streaming variable-length output via `Absorb` / `Squeeze` / `Reset`.
BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, and BLAKE3 use managed SIMD intrinsics (SSE2, SSSE3, AVX2) with scalar fallback.

### 🧪 Package Benchmarks

- [Async primitive benchmarks](https://cryptohives.github.io/Foundation/packages/threading/benchmarks.html) — contested and uncontested scenarios, comparing pooled `ValueTask` vs. existing `Task`-based alternatives.
- [Hash algorithm benchmarks](https://cryptohives.github.io/Foundation/packages/security/cryptography/benchmarks.html) — measured with BenchmarkDotNet across 128B–128KB payloads, comparing managed vs. BouncyCastle vs. OS implementations.

### 🔒 Fuzzed APIs (planned)
- All libraries and public-facing APIs are planned to be fuzzed

## 🧩 Installation

Install via NuGet CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading
```

Or using the Visual Studio Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading
```

---

## 🧠 Usage Examples

---

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Security.Cryptography.Hash;

// Allocation-free hash
using var blake3 = Blake3.Create();
Span<byte> hash = stackalloc byte[32];
blake3.TryComputeHash(data, hash, out _);

// XOF streaming (variable-length output)
using var shake = Shake256.Create(64);
shake.Absorb(data1);
shake.Absorb(data2);
Span<byte> output = stackalloc byte[128];
shake.Squeeze(output);
```

---

```csharp
using CryptoHives.Foundation.Threading.Async.Pooled;

// Allocation-free async lock, even with cancellation token
private readonly AsyncLock _lock = new();

public async Task DoWorkAsync(CancellationToken ct)
{
    using await _lock.LockAsync(ct).ConfigureAwait(false);
    // critical section
}
```

---

## 🧪 Development Policy

All code within the **CryptoHives .NET Foundation** is developed with attention to correctness and security:

- Implementations are written from official public specifications and standards (NIST, RFC, ISO)
- All algorithms are verified against official test vectors from specification documents
- Review process includes algorithm validation against reference implementations
- Development may use AI-assisted tooling; no guarantee of clean-room provenance is claimed

---

## 🔐 Security Policy

Security is our top priority.

If you discover a vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue.**  
Instead, please follow the guidelines on the [CryptoHives Open Source Initiative Security Page](https://github.com/CryptoHives/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## 🔏 Nuget Package Assembly Code Signing

Assemblies in our Nuget packages are currently not code signed. Once there is sufficient demand and funding available, the Keepers plan to implement code signing for all released packages.

---

## 📝 No-Nonsense Matters

This project is released under the MIT License because open collaboration matters.  
However, the Keepers are well aware that MIT-licensed code often gets copied, repackaged, or commercialized without giving credit.  

If you use this code, please do so responsibly:
- Give visible credit to the **CryptoHives Open Source Initiative** or **The Keepers of the CryptoHives** and refer to the original source.
- Contribute improvements back and report issues.

Open source thrives on respect, not just permissive licenses.
